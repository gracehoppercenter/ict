<h2>Context: What You Need to Know When You Get Here</h2>
<p>
The computer science pathway at Arlington Tech has been designed from <q>the
ground up</q> to be an integrated sequence of courses leading to a solid,
rigerous foundation in the field that will prepare students well for both
further study and employment.
</p><p>
While we highly encourage interested students to follow our
<a href="https://apscs.org/index.html?school=acc">full pathway</a> beginning
with DE Web Design, this document is for those students who want to join the
path at other entry points.
</p><p>
Students enrolling in CSC 221 will be expected to have the following skills
on arrival, as we will not be able to dedicate class time to aquiring them.

<h3>Managing Your Computer from the Unix CLI</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will work in a Unix
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">CLI</a>
environment, using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)">Vim</a> as our
text editor, and saving (and <q>submitting</q>) our work in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">git</a> repositories.
</p><p>
You will need to be <i>comfortable</i>, not just <q>familiar</q> with these
tools to keep up in this class.
</p><p>
Here are several resources to learn what you need:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/">UNIX Tutorial for
  Beginners</a>. Read
  <a href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unixintro.html">
  Introduction to the UNIX Operating System</a> and complete Tutorials
  <a href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unix1.html">One</a>,
  <a href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unix2.html">Two</a>, and
  <a href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unix3.html">Three</a>.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.mprat.org/Terminus/">Terminus</a> is a
  <i>gamified</i> way to learn / practice Unix CLI skills.</li>

  <li><b>VIM Tutor</b>. At your linux terminal prompt, type:
  <code>vimtutor</code> and hit enter. This loads a script that copies
  a text file to the <code>/tmp</code> and load it into vim. File contains
  a tutorial on using this power, but somewhat difficult to get used to at
  first editor. Use it to learn vim.</li> 

  <li><a href="https://vimschool.netlify.app/">Vim School</a> is a website
  designed to help you learn Vim.</li>

  <li><a href="https://vim-adventures.com/">Vim Adventures</a> helps you
  learn Vim keybindings by playing a game.</li>

  <li><a href="https://learngitbranching.js.org/">Learn Git Branching</a> is
  an interactive, online tutorial for git.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Some Programming Experience in Some Programming Language</h3>
<p>
We will start at the very beginning learning Python, but we will
<i>move fast</i>. You will take the
<a href="https://pythoninstitute.org/pcep">PCEP</a> certification exam at the
end of first quarter. Only students who earn the certification will be able
to earn an A in the class.
</p><p>
Our Web students learned
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, but as long
as you have a bit of programming experience in any programming language, so
that you are already familiar with conditional statements, loops, and
functions, you will be fine in this class.
