# ICT and CS @ Arlington Tech Governor's STEM Academy Website

This is the website for the web development and computer science programs at
the [Arlington Tech Governor's STEM Academy](https://arlingtontech.apsva.us/).


## Site Map Naming 

The root of the website is the ``docs`` directory.

Each child of the ``docs`` directory contains semester curriculum data, with
``f`` for Fall, ``s`` for Spring, and a two digit year of the 21st century
(``f25`` for the Fall 2025 semester, for example).

The top level ``resources`` directory contains resources useful for maintaining
this website that are not part of the site itself.
