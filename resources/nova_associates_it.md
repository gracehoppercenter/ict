# New IT/Cybersecurity/Data Science Programs

We would like to offer this program here at Arlington Tech: [Information Technology, A.S.](https://catalog.nvcc.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=15&poid=3797).

This program gives students a lot of freedom to mix and match elective courses. We identified two "flavors" of this program that we can promote to students: one that focuses on cybersecurity, and one that focuses on web/databases

Other courses that might satisfy this technical elective include DE Statistics (MTH 245/246).

## Other NOVA Programs

Here are some other NOVA programs we're exploring, but did not align on:
* [Information Systems Technology: Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics, C.S.C.](https://catalog.nvcc.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=15&poid=3835&returnto=1877)
* [Cybersecurity, A.A.S.](https://catalog.nvcc.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=15&poid=3745)
* [Information Systems Technology, A.A.S.](https://catalog.nvcc.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=15&poid=3799&returnto=1877)
* [Information Systems Technology: Web Design and Development, C.S.C.](https://catalog.nvcc.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=15&poid=3810)


For each of these, there are open questions about how transferrable the credentials
and the required courses are to the four-year programs our students attend.


## Proposed Course Changes

We discussed several possible changes to our course offerings. We did not agree
on any immediate changes. I'm documenting here so that we have notes for future 
conversations.

- DE Web Design:
	- We considered a few changes, but decided to stick with
	the current courses, because they can be "mixed", which is important for
	AT freshmen
	- ITD210 is required for the Web Design CSC
- ITE 170 - Multimedia Software (3 CR.)
	- This is a requirement for the IT AAS, and for the Web Design CSC.
	- This probably aligns well with John Woodhead's Graphic Communication Systems class, which is not DE, but does culminate in [Adobe certification](https://www.nvcc.edu/admissions/cpl.html). There is no certification currently listed on the CPL website for this course, but previous conversations with the CPL office have considered adding it
- ITD 140/145/245 (Data Science and Machine Learning Classes)
	- Gerri and Deirdre are hoping to pilot a new DE Data Science class at ACC starting in 2026. These courses would be required for the AI CSC
- ITE 152 
	- This is required for the IT pathway and currently is coupled in Cyber I. The other three courses in Cyber I are optional electives for the IT AS. For our Web/Databases "flavor", we could also suggest that students take this course in Early Online College
- CSC221
	- The AS IT requires a 4-credit programming elective. CSC221 is not on the list of choices, so we would need to request an exception for this class.
	- We would hope to use the same substitution for similar requirements in
		- The IT AAS (requires ITP 100 - Software Design (3 CR.))
		- The Cybersecurity AAS ((the same 4-credit programming elective requirement))
		- The AI CSC (requires ITP 150 - Python Programming (4 CR.))
		- The Web Design CSC (requires ITP 100 - Software Design (3 CR.))
